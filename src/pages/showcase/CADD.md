##Â Drug discovery pipeline
![Pipeline overview](/images/cadd_fig1_b.png)

Computational approaches are useful tools to expedite the drug discovery or design process. Traditional HTS approaches are expensive and have a percentage yield of leads of as low as 0.001%.
Every step of the drug discovery process can be aided by *in-silico* approaches. We propose solutions to maximize the lead yield and minimize the drug-to-patient time, making the best out of your R&D investment. 

### Identifying a druggable target

Search databases intelligently: Screen and prioritize compounds for synthesis, search FDA databases for drug repurposing strategies, create Metabolic maps to identify possible targets, model and predict protein structures...


### Finding the Lead 

Perform Virtual High Throughput Screening utilizing either structure-based or ligand-based discovery approaches. Apply docking strategies for known target structures or QSAR models for undefined target three-dimensional conformation. Model pharmacophores, identify binding pockets, perform molecular fingerprinting and similarity searches, design multi-target ligands.


### Optimizing your Lead compound

Utilize QSAR modelling for lead optimization strategies...


### Evaluating ADMET properties

Evaluate the predicted ADMET properties and discard unwanted compounds. Filter libraries, lead compounds, predict off-target activity, Cytochrome P450 metabolism and anti-target binding evaluation through docking simulation,
