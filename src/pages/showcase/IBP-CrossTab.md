          The IBP provides the tools, technologies and expertise sought by plant breeding programs in the public and private sectors, mainly in developing countries, as well as by universities engaged in teaching and research for the next generation of plant breeders. We build on the considerable legacy and networks of the former Generation Challenge Programme (GCP) to connect researchers, technicians and students at the local, regional and international levels. In doing so, the IBP is able to draw upon comprehensive knowledge and resources that are invaluable to strengthen the delivery chain for key staple food crops.

           (Also directly from IBP webpage)
           Modern plant breeding programs, with good data management practices, meeting demand-led objectives in the context of a value chain approach that addresses consumer demand, agro-ecological challenges, and local production needs. Through the enhancement of plant breeding programs, and the sharing of knowledge resources across chain actors, we envisage improved livelihoods for farming families in developing countries.

## CrossTab

In the context of a collaboration between IBP and Globant, we are creating an innovative tool that will allow the breeders create recommendations based on the desired traits for the new crops to come. This platform helps the producer choose the right germoplasm to breed between hundreds of options, reducing experimentation costs and times. 

### Stage 1: The breeder decides what are the desired traits

![Stage 1](/images/IBP_Stage1.jpg)

The system will allow the breeder to select the traits on which the decision will be based. The traits can be both quantitative or qualitative and all the selection criteria will be contemplated, permitting the breeder choose between all the imaginable scenarios. This will result in the best possible control over the offspring. 

### Stage 2: CrossTab calculates the best fit among the available germoplasm

A confidence average will be calculated based on wether each desired condition is met and the weight the breeder has assigned to each one of them. An extra level of complexity will be archieved uploading genetic information for the germoplasm, which will be utilized to calculate a genetic variability index and the inherited genetic traits if available. 

### Stage 3: The results are displayed for the breeder to assess

The possible crosses will be arranged from best-fit to worse-fit based on the calculated confidence average and displayed as a clickable histogram for the breeder.

Additionally, a table will be generated displaying all the possible crosses **and the actual values for each trait**, which will allow the breeder to select the crosses which will be used to proceed with the breeding experiments.

### Stage 4: The breeder can receive the information via email

All the information can be sent to the breeder's email for future reference. The crosses will also be saved in the CrossTab application for convenience, and to allow a rapid refill of the requeriments in case subtle changes need to be made to the cross to obtain different results and compare between them. **A comparison tool between the various results will be added in a future version of the tool.**
